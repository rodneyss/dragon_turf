== README

Geolocation game where certain geo-points have monsters that you can attack. Has a dynamic creation of monsters that spawn within 1km of player. 

Many things to add but wont be done untill code is ported and optimized to work on mobile:

* raids/parties

* guild/clan

* shop

* more spell 

* more items

* pvp

* optimize the logic
